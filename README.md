# Sit-on-chair
My first landing page sample made as a result of the HTML and CSS module on the Coderslab bootcamp. 

The project was created based on the visual mock-up (screenshot of the page) received on the course. My task was to reconstruct the page from the scratch using HTML and CSS. I decided to add something extra: use of SASS and some RWD units and tools (for now I created only one break-point for max-width: 767px).

The project is still under construction.
